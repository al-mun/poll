Poll page project
This is a poll page project that I worked on in class at BC. It uses a database to store the information of the users that visit the site and take the poll. If the user has taken the poll before they cannot retake it with the same email. After making the selection in the poll the user will be shown the results of the poll based on other answers.

This is the final version of the Poll Page.
